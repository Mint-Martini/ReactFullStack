# ReactFullStack

First of all Thanks for Looking at my code!
I actally had alot of fun doing this, Please feel free to message me any quetions!

## Prerequisites/General Info  ##

This Project really has 2 Parts that you need to run both ***React.JS*** and a NPM Package called ***JSON-Server*** ( A mock API Rest server that runs on your local Machine) :)

You could in theory just need React.js but the POST request wouldnt return.


### Setting Up React.JS ###
- - - -

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
This should create all the React scripts you need!
